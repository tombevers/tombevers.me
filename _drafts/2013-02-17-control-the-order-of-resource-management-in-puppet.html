A common heard complaint when using <a title="What is Puppet" href="https://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet/" target="_blank">Puppet</a> for managing resources is that it is difficult to manage the order of how resources should be executed.
<blockquote>The order of resources in a Puppet manifest does not matter. Puppet assumes that most resources are not related to each other and will manage the resources in whatever order is most efficient</blockquote>
This means that you'll need to explicitly define relationships between resource to run them in a specific order. Relationships can be declared by:
<ul>
	<li>Relationship metaparameters</li>
	<li>Chaining arrows</li>
	<li>The require function</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relationship metaparameters</h3>
<h3>Chaining arrows</h3>
<h3>The <code>require</code> function</h3>
