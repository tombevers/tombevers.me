Sometimes if you execute a script via the CLI you get following error <strong>/bin/sh^M : bad interpreter</strong>.

This is because of the line endings in your file are <strong>DOS</strong> line endings. The clue is the ^M. What you need to do is just re-save the file using Unix line endings.

To fix this, open your script with <strong>vi</strong> or <strong>vim</strong> and enter in vi command mode (key ESC), then type this:

<pre>:set fileformat=unix</pre>

Finally save it

<pre>:x! or :wq!</pre>
