<p>I once had created a tag and pushed it to a remote repository, but my tag was bad. Luckily you can delete a (remote) tag from a repository in git.</p>

<p>My bad tag is called '1.0.1' in the example below:</p>
<pre name="code"><strong>git tag -d 1.0.1</strong>
This deletes the tag from your local branch.
<strong>git push origin :refs/tags/1.0.1</strong>
This deletes the tag from the remote repository.</pre>
