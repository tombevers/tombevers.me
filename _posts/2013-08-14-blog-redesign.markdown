Finally I taken some time to redesign my blog, I hope you like it. If you have any suggestions please let me know as there is always room for improvement.

Not only there has taken a redesign place but the engine also has changed. I'm no longer using [Wordpress][wordpress] but [Jekyll][jekyll] as engine instead for this blog. It's a simple, blog aware, static site generator.

If you want to learn more about [Jekyll][jekyll] checkout the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info.
